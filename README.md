Had some trouble evaluting results using the arrays, also couldn't get sounds to auto play, which is probably for the best but detracted from the theme I was going for.

After I turned the arrays to strings everything started to work.  I went back and blocked some code into functions but didn't create any objects.  Spent a lot of time with the CSS and still can't't get page layout to do what I want without a lot of margin fanagling.
